# Linear Regression #
ρ

## Simple Linear Regression ##

### Correlation and slope ###
> If X & Y are jointly normal (for each fixed X(Y) then Y(X) is normal) then

```math
	μ_x|y= α + β*x
```

> and

```math
	β= ( σ_y / σ_x ) * ρ
```

> **which shows the relation between correlation and slope of regression**
