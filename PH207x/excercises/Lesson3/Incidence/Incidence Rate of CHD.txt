# Incidence Rate Calculation

Incidence Rate at time "t"= IR(t)
= (# of new cases occurring during interval around "t") / (amount of person-time observed during the interval)

Question: Why divide by person-time?

## Incidence Rate Calculation
Suppose you have 100 people who are "at-risk" during the one-week period around "t" and 5 develop the disease.

IR(t)= 5 cases of disease / (7*100) person-days= 71.428571 cases/person-days

-> Two week period
IR(t)= 10 / 14*100= 71.428571 cases/person-days

-> General Case: IR(t)= Average IR(t)
