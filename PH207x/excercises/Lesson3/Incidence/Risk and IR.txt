# Risk and IR 

## Example
Suppose you followed 1000 people for 1 year and the Incidence Rate (IR) was 10/(100y)

Q1) How much person-time would you observe?
ca. 1000 person years

Q2) How many cases of disease would you observe?
100

Q3) What is one-year Cumulative Incidence?
100/1000=10%

=> Approximation Formular: Risk= IR*dt

Example: 
- IR=10/100y
- One year Risk= (10/100y)(1y)= 10%
-> Problem: Formula doesn't take into account correct amount of person-time
-> Approximation works well for small IR and short dt
