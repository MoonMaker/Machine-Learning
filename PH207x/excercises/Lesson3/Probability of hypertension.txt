# Probability of Hypertension
3004 - No Hypertension
1430 - Yes: With hypertension
4340 - Sum of population

1.) What is the probability that a randomly selected participant in the Framingham study had hypertension at baseline?
Event H=individual had hypertension
P(H)= # with hyptertension / # of population= 1430/4434= 0.32

2.) What is the probability that this participant did not have hypertension at baseline?
P(H^c)= 1-P(H)= 1-0.32=0.68

3.) Are these events mutually exclusive, exhaustive, neither, or both?
both

4.) What is the probability that three randomly selected participants all have hypertension at baseline? Recall P(no hypertension)= 0.6775
P(H)=0.68
P(all 3hyp)=P(H)*P(H)*P(H)= P(H)^3= 0.68^3= 0.31

5.) Suppose we randomly select two participants. What is the probability that both participants have hypertension at baseline, given that at least one has hypertension.
Recall P(hypertension)=0.3225
A= both have hypertension
B= one has hypertension
P(A|B)= P(A and B) / P(B)= P(A) / P(B)
= P(H)P(H) / ( P(H)+P(H) - P(H)*P(H) )= 0.19

-> This is an "or" type event: P(H)+P(H)
-> Both have hypertension: P(H)*P(H)
-> or hypertension - both: P(H)+P(H) - P(H)*P(H)
