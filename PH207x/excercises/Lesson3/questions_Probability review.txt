# Probability review

=> Remember
1)For A and B to be INDEPENDENT: P(AnB)= P(A)*P(B)
2)For A and B to be MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: P(AuB)= P(A)+P(B)
3)General Formula for the UNION of A and B: P = P(A)+P(B)-[P(A)*P(B)] 


1.) Can events A and B be both mutually exclusive and independent with respect to each other?
Yes 
-> No

2.) If B is the complement of A, A and B are:
mutually exclusive 
exhaustive 
-> both mutually exclusive AND exhaustive

3.) As the probability of disease decreases, the sensitivity of a test will decrease.
True 
-> False

4.) As the probability of disease decreases, the specificity of a test will decrease.
True 
-> False

5.) As the probability of disease decreases, the positive predictive value of a test will decrease.
-> True 
False

6.) As the probability of disease decreases, the negative predictive value of a test will decrease.
True 
-> False
