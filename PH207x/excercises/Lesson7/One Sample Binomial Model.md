# Categorical Data #

## One Sample Binomial Model  ##
> p = probability of success  
> n = number of trials
> mean = n*p  
> sd = sqrt( mean*(1-p) )
> X = number of successess

> We have to calculate the left probability!

### Estimator of p ###
> n trials, x successes= SUM i=1 to n d_i
> where d_i = 1 if i_th trial is a success,  
>           = 0 if i_th trial is a failure  
>  
> p= x/n= 1/n * SUM i=1 to n d_i
