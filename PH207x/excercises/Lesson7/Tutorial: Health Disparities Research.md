# Tutorial: Health Disparities Research #
The pathways between race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and health disparities are complex in the United States, e.g. [1, 2]. Using observational public databases like CHIS, we can investigate issues in health disparities. (However, it is important to always remember that association is not causation, and consequently we can only talk about observed associations in the dataset.)

As a simple example, we investigate the relationship between poverty-level and visiting the doctor in the past year. As in last weekâ€™s tutorial, we use a random sample of 500 respondents from the 2009 CHIS survey. (If you wish to do a more detailed analysis, you can download the entire CHIS dataset from their website.)
