## Sampling Methods ##
Several Sampling methods:

* Simple random sampling (SRS) 
* Stratified Sampling 
* Cluster Sampling 


### Design Effect ###
Design Effect (DEFF) is the ratio of the variance under the design used, to the variance with simple random sampling. e.g. DEFF=2 means you need twice as big a sample to get the same variance as you would get with a simple random sample.

## Tutorial: Survey Designs  ##
> Real-world, publicly available survey data is often very complex. Consequently, we will use "hypothetical" data for all of the tutorials in this week's tutorial sequence, estimating p, the prevalence of a disease, say malaria, in a hypothetical country, called Inventia.

Province | Population size | Number of districts
-------- | --------------- | --------------------
 1       | 225000          | 50
 2       | 150000          | 42
 3       | 100000          | 32
 4       |  25000          | 23
 Total   | 500000          | 146

> We know that p differs between different provinces, due to the different hypothetical climates in each area. p may also vary somewhat between districts, given different access to malaria prevention. For instance, urban populations may have more resources to prevent malaria, and thus a lower prevalence. The true prevalence of malaria in Inventia is 13.1%.

> In the following tutorial, we examine how to analyze data from several different survey designs: 

* Simple random sampling (SRS) - We randomly sample 1,000 people.
* Stratified Sampling - We randomly sample 250 people from each of the 4 provinces of Inventia.
* Cluster Sampling - We randomly sample 25 districts from Inventia and randomly sample 40 people within each district.
* Stratified Cluster sampling - Within each of the 4 provinces, we sample 5 districts and sample 50 people within each selected district.
