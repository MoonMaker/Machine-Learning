# Pre Test:

Pretest: Prevalence is 16.1%. Which means out of 100 people, 16.1 people have disease. That means 100 - 16.1 do not have the disease.

# Post Test

* When the test is carried out, ideally all 16.1 should test positive, But the sensitivity being 0.721, out of 16.1, only (16.1 * 0.721) test positive. Remaining test -ve inspite of having disease. So 16.1 - (16.1 * 0.721) is the number of cases who have disease and yet have tested negative (False Negative).

* So the proportion who test FN is = Number tested False Negative in Step 2 / Total No of patients with disease (16.1). This will give you your FN rate.

* Now from Step 1 we know how many people do not have disease. This is the number which should ideally test -ve if the specificity was 100% i.e. 1. But since specificity is only 0.932, only (100 - 16.1) * 0.932 test -ve.

* This means ((100 - 16.1) - (100 - 16.1) * 0.932) test positive inspite of not having a disease. These are your False Positive Cases.

* So now calculate the FP rate similar to how we calculated FN rate.

* Now you have your FN and FP rates. Be happy.

* Now your PPV is TRUE POSITIVE / TOTAL POSITIVE. Here true positive is the value you got in Step 2 (16.1* sensitivity)). And Total Positives is this value plus FP you got in step 5.

* Similarly your NPV is True Negative / Total Negative values.

* Use the formula 1-PPV and 1-NPV.

* If you get all correct, you must wear a big smile!
