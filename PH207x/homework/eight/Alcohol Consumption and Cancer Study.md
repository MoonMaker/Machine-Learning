# Alcohol Consumption and Cancer Study #
> Dr. Marks is interested in examining the association between alcohol consumption and a rare form of cancer. Since it is hard to identify cases, Dr. Marks designs a case-control study. Cases are identified from cancer treatment centers across the United States. Controls are selected on the day that the case is diagnosed with cancer from among the relatives of the cancer patient.

#### 1. True or False: Dr. Marks should make sure to select the healthiest relative as the control to ensure that he will observe differences in risk between cases and controls. ####

* True
* False 

#### 2. The main concern of using relatives of cases as the controls is that #### 

* Some cases may not have relatives that drink alcohol. 
* NOPE: Some cases may have relatives that live far away so not all relatives will be available to participate. 
* Relatives of cases may be more likely to have levels of alcohol consumption that are more similar to the cases than the population that gave rise to the cancer cases. 
* NOPE: The controls may develop other diseases and will not be available to participate in this study. 

#### 3. Based on the study description above, Dr. Marks conducted a #### 

* Density case-control study 
* Nested case-control study 
* Case-cohort study 
* Retrospective cohort study 

#### 4. True or False: Using this design, a relative who served as a control cannot be included as a case if he later develops the cancer of interest. #### 

* True
* False 

#### 5. True or False: Using the data collected in this study, Dr. Marks will be able to estimate the rates for developing this cancer. #### 

* True
* False
