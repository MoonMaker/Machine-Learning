# Other Aspects of Survey Design #
> Thus far, we have examined sampling design, which is only one element of designing a survey. Building and testing the survey instrument/questionnaire, anticipating and preparing for non-response, and training field teams to conduct the survey are several other critical aspects that we have not even touched on!

> Use the Boston physical health survey example from the previous question to answer the following:  

### 1. When designing your survey, you are trying to decide whether to use a 2-page questionnaire with 15 simple questions about whether an individual exercises, how many times per week, and whether they have a history of diabetes, along with some other very basic demographics (call this Survey 1). Your colleague says you could get much better information if you used a 10 page questionnaire with a more complete medical history and history of exercise and physical activity (call this Survey 2).###
> Krosnick (1991) discusses “satisficing” (satisfy + suffice) in surveys. To paraphrase this discussion, satisficing occurs when, rather than optimizing their responses to best reflect reality, survey respondents try to reduce the cognitive burden associated with the survey and consequently may select a survey response haphazardly or even arbitrarily.


> **Survey 1**
* 15 simple questions about whether an individual exercises, 
* how many times per week
* whether they have a history of diabetes, along with some other very basic demographics

> **Survey 2**
* 10 page questionnaire with a more complete medical history 
* history of exercise 
* physical activity



#### Which survey would be more susceptible to satisficing? ####

* Survey 1 
* Survey 2

### 2.You decide to implement a door-to-door survey, where you randomly sample addresses within a neighborhood and train a field team to ask the survey questions at the selected households. (You have a complete listing of addresses in Boston). ### 
> Your colleague says you should obtain a listing of all land-line telephone numbers in Boston (a listing of cell phone numbers is not available) and randomly sample numbers from this list and ask the questions over the phone. For sake of argument, assume that you get a 100% response rate for both modes (door to door and phone calls), and that you construct survey weights using the table above. 

#### Would you expect the door-to-door or land-line method to produce unbiased results? (Think about which sampling frame is likely to be more complete.) ####

* door-to-door 
* landline 


#### Would you expect the door-to-door or land-line method to be cheaper to implement? ####

* door-to-door
* landline 

> *Note: web-based surveys are also common. In order to minimize non-response, some surveys use multiple modes of response and follow-up (e.g. web + phone; or web + household follow-up).*


### 3. Individuals can opt out of any part of your survey. High BMI and low physical activity are risk factors for diabetes, and you find that individuals with these characteristics are less likely to answer questions about history of diabetes (note that high BMI and low physical activity are risk factors for diabetes). In a complete case analysis, missing data is dropped, survey weights are recalculated, and data is analyzed assuming missing observations were never collected. In a complete case analysis, would you expect to obtain unbiased estimates of diabetes prevalence in Boston? ###

* No 
* Yes
