# Survey Design #
> You decide to conduct a survey to measure physical activity in Boston. You plan to collect information on the amount of physical activity per week, history of diabetes, weight, height, age, and gender.  
>  
> There are seventeen distinct neighborhoods in Boston, with substantial differences in race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and population density. You expect to observe variability in physical activity indicators by neighborhood. Unfortunately there is no specific information about within-neighborhood heterogeneity (variance); therefore, you design the survey based on the assumption that variances of indicators are equal across neighborhoods.

>The table below displays population data for Boston in 2010. Assume that these population numbers are still accurate today.
