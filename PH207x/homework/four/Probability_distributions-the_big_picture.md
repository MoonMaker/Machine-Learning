# Probability distributions: the big picture
Recap: In the last several questions about designing a study, we have learned about properties of common probability models in statistics, namely that:

1. The _______ provides a good approximation to the binomial distribution when the event of interest is rare and the study population is large.
-> Poisson 
normal 
exponential

2. The _______ provides a good approximation to the binomial distribution when the event of interest is not rare and the study population is large.
Poisson 
-> normal 
exponential
