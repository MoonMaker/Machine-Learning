# Probability distributions: the big picture
Recap: In the last several questions about designing a study, we have learned about properties of common probability models in statistics, namely that:

##### Q1. The _______ provides a good approximation to the binomial distribution when the event of interest is rare and the study population is large. #####

 * **Poisson**
 * normal 
 * exponential

##### Q2. The _______ provides a good approximation to the binomial distribution when the event of interest is not rare and the study population is large. #####

 * Poisson
 * **normal**
 * exponential
