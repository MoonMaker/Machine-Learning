## Confounding Multiple Choice ##
> Select the best answer: In the presence of confounding,
* The crude (unadjusted) results are not correct if the sample size is small. 
* The exposed and unexposed are exchangeable. 
* => **The results are not correct because there is a third factor associated with exposure and outcome that at least partially explains the results. (In other words: the results obtained directly are not correct, that's why they need to be adjusted )**
* Stratification is not appropriate.
