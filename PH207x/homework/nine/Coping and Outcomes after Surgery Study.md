## Coping and Outcomes after Surgery Study  ##
> Dr. Spencer is conducting a study to evaluate whether better coping styles are associated with improved outcomes after undergoing surgery. He is concerned that people with better coping styles have other healthy lifestyle factors and more social support that also impact post-surgery prognosis.

#### 1. True or False: Because people cannot be randomized to a particular coping style, Dr. Spencer cannot test his hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial to assure that the correct counterfactual outcomes can be compared properly. Therefore, there is no way to evaluate this question.####
* Yes
* => **No**

#### 2. Dr. Spencer chooses to draw a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is useful because ####

* It prevents confounding so that stratification is not necessary. 
* => **It helps the researcher evaluate the relationship between the factors under study to decide when stratification or statistical adjustment is appropriate.**
* It addresses issues of chance and how that impacts the results of a stratified analysis.

#### 3. True or False: In terms of examining whether there is a causal effect of exposure on outcome, Dr. Spencer wants to make sure that the risk of poor post-surgery prognosis is similar for all factors other than coping styles. This is important to achieve exchangeability to conclude that differences in coping styles is causing the differences in the risk of the outcome. ####
* => **Yes**
* No
