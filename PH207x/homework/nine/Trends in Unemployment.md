## Trends in Unemployment ##
> We again use publicly available data from the World Bankâ€™s website to examine national trends in unemployment percentages (percent unemployed in total labor force) in four countries: the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and Canada.  
>  
In this question, we examine unemployment trends over time using a correlation analysis, focusing primarily on the United States and Japan.  
>  
> Use the dataset UnemploymentbyCountry.dta to answer the following questions. 

### Consider the following questions: ###

#### 1. Calculate the Pearson and Spearman correlations between total unemployment and year for the United States and for Japan. ####

##### United States: ######
* Pearson:
* Spearman: 

##### Japan: ######
* Pearson:
* Spearman: 


#### 2. Exclude all years after 2007 (recall that the financial collapse occurred in late 2008). Recalculate the correlations in question 1. (Hint: use an "if" command to restrict to certain years in Stata.) ####

##### United States: ######
* Pearson:
* Spearman: 

##### Japan: ######
* Pearson:
* Spearman: 


#### 3. Construct a scatter plot with year on the x-axis and with both unemployment in the United States and unemployment in Japan on the y-axis. ####
> **Hint1:** try plotting different symbols for the United States and Japan by creating two different plots within the Twoway graphs window; restrict to a specific country by using an "if" statement within each plot window).

##### Which pattern best describes the trend in unemployment in the United States between 1980 and 2010? ##### 
* linear 
* quadratic 
* cyclic
* gradual non-linear increase 


##### Which pattern best describes the trend in unemployment in the Japan between 1980 and 2010? #####

#### 4. True or False: correlation analyses have the potential to mask important non-linear trends in data. ####
* True:
* False: 

#### 5. Restricting to the United States, construct a scatterplot with year on the x-axis and with total unemployment; unemployment among women; and unemployment among men on the y-axis. Do there appear to be sex-specific differences in the unemployment trends? #### 
* True:
* False:
