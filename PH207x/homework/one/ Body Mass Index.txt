Body Mass Index

Again using the Framingham dataset, we examine the continuous variable, body mass index (BMI).
1. To quickly examine the interquartile range for BMI at exam 1 in the study population, which graph would you use?
-> Boxplot



2. We say an individual has high BMI at exam 1 if his BMI is greater than 25. How many individuals in the dataset have high BMI at exam 1? 
codebook bmi1
generate bmihigh1 = .	
replace bmihigh1 = 1 if bmi1 >25 & bmi1 <= 60
tabulate bmihigh1
drop bmihigh1

3. What percent of the study population had high BMI at exam 1 (an individual has high BMI at exam 1 if his BMI is greater than 25). Express your answer as a proportion of the whole (e.g. 10% would be .10)
