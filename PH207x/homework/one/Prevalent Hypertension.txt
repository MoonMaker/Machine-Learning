Prevalent Hypertension

We will use the Framingham dataset to explore data types, and graphs in this questions. We will examine the indicator of prevalent hypertension at exam 1(variable name: prevhyp1).
1. Prevalent hypertension at exam 1 is an example of what type of data?
-> Binary [0,1]

2. How many individuals in the Framingham dataset had prevalent hypertension at exam 1?
tabulate sex1 prevhyp1
-> 1430

3. What is the relative frequency of prevalent hypertension at exam 1? Express your answer as a proportion of the whole (e.g. 10% would be .10).
-> 0.32250789355

4. Among the individuals with prevalent hypertension at exam 1, how many are female?
-> 799

5. What proportion of individuals with prevalent hypertension at exam 1 are female? Express your answer as a proportion of the whole (e.g. 10% would be .10). 
tab prevhyp1 sex1, cell
by sex1, sort : summarize prevhyp1
di (100*799)/1430
-> 0.559

6. Which graph would you use to summarize the distribution of the indicator for prevalent hypertension at exam 1 in the study population?
-> Scatter plot
