#Toxins and Parkinson's Disease Cohort Study#
> An investigator, Dr. Park, is interested in evaluating whether there is an association between exposures to toxins and risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. She constructs a cohort of men and women that are living in her state in 1985 and every year, they are asked to complete a questionnaire about exposures at work and at home and whether they have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The participants in Dr. Park’s study contribute information on their changing toxin exposures over time for as long as they are residents in that state and for any year that they complete the questionnaire. As new people move into the state, they are enrolled in her cohort and remain in the cohort for as long as they are residents in the state and complete the questionnaire.

#### 1.Should Dr. Park include people who reported that they had Parkinson’s at the time that they were recruited? ####
> Yes   
> => **No** 


#### 2.Does Dr. Park need to be concerned about selection bias? ####
> => **Yes, if people who were at greater risk of developing Parkinson’s were more likely to be exposed and were also more likely to participate in the study**  
> No, because it is a prospective cohort study so selection biases are not a concern 


#### 3.If those who are exposed to toxins are more likely to drop out of the study and more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease, what effect with this have on the estimated relative risk compared to the true relative risk? ####
> **Hint1:** I think the study hypothesis - there is an association btwn toxin and Parkinson, so the null is opposite to the study hypothesis i.e Ho= there is no association between the two. More exposed ppl are likely to develop the disease, and if these ppl drop out of the study, you will find the end result to be less ppl with the disease and likely to conclude there is no association btwn the two, which is, what do you think? away or towards or no effect to the Ho?   
>  
> No effect   
> => **Biased towards the null**  
> Biased away from the null 


#### 4.Is this an open cohort or closed cohort? Why? ####
> Closed, because exposure at baseline is used for all follow-up   
> Open, because loss to follow-up and competing risks are still a problem in this population-based study   
> Closed, because risk ratios are the most appropriate measure to compare toxin levels and Parkinson’s risk  
> => **Open, because people can enter and exit the cohort over the follow up time of the study**

#### 5.True or False: Based on the data collected in her study, Dr. Park will be able to calculate absolute measures of Parkinson’s disease incidence. ####
> False  
> => **True** 

> Absolute risk (incidence, prevalence):  
> Incidence = number of new cases of a disease occurring in a specified time period divided by the number of individuals at risk of developing the disease during the same time

#### 6.Because Dr. Park conducted a prospective cohort study instead of a cross-sectional study, she can be less concerned about ####
> Confounding  
> Bias  
> => **Reverse causation**  
> Chance
