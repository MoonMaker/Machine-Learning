#Bed Occupancy in Two Hospitals#
An investigator performs a bed-occupancy survey on July 1, 2012 at two hospitals (Hospital A and Hospital B).   
Hospital A has 100 available beds.  
Hospital B is larger with 200 available beds.  
Hospital A reports that 80 of its beds are occupied on the day of the survey (occupancy prevalence = 0.80).

1. The investigator reports a Prevalence Odds Ratio of 2.25 when comparing the occupancy prevalence of Hospital B to that for Hospital A. What is the occupancy prevalence for Hospital B on that day? 

Prevalence Odds Ratio=2.25

(occ.bed/non occ bed)=2.25*4, 
(occ bed+non occ bed)=200
(occ bed+non occ bed)=2.25*4*(non occ bed)+(non occ bed)=200

occ bed= 9*(non occ bed)-non occ bed+(non occ bed)

occ prev for hospB=occ bed/200

Just sharing the step: We've known the total beds for
Hb = 200 
y= 9/1

1) OR(Hb to Ha) = OR(Hb)/ OR(Ha) 
2) OR(Hb) = OR(Hb to Ha)*OR(Ha)=2.25*4= y


Example : Total students are 49. How many female and male students if the ratio is 3:4? Answer : *Female : (3/7)*49 = 21 *Male : (4/7)*49=28 Formula above is same to calculate OR(Hb) that I wrote. So, after you know the count of beds that occupied and not occupied in hospital B, ofcourse, you can calculate its occupied prevalance
