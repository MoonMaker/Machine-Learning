#Nursing Home Study#
Suppose that 500 residents of a large nursing home are screened for hypertension. All residents with above a specified level are labeled as having hypertension. The following table displays the results of this study.

Nursing Home Study Results
       | Hypertension | No Hypertension | Total   | Risk   
------ | ------------ | --------------- | ------- | -------
Male   | 100          | 100             | 200     | 100/200
Female | 100          | 200             | 300     | 100/300


1. Which of the following measures of association would be the most appropriate to use to describe the finding in this study? 

> Cumulative Ratio  
> Incidence Rate Ratio  
> => **Prevalence Ratio**

2. What is the prevalence of hypertension among all residents? 
> prevalence of hypertension = (total number of people with hypertension)/(total number of people in study)  
> prevalence of hypertension = 200/500= 0.4

3. What is the prevalence odds ratio for having hypertension comparing male residents (exposed group) to female residents (non-exposed group)?
> Prevalence odds= prev/1-prev 
> R1= 100/200= 0.5  
> R2= 100/300= 0.33333333  
> R1/(1-R1)= 1  
> R2/(1-R2)= 0.49999999  

> => R1/R2= 1/0.49999999= **2**
