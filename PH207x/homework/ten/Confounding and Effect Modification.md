Dr. Smith conducts a randomized clinical trial to determine if aspirin reduces the risk of heart attack. Fifty percent of male patients are exposed and fifty percent of female patients are exposed. He finds an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.75 comparing people who were assigned to take aspirin to those assigned to placebo. Among men, he finds that those assigned to take aspirin have an IRR=0.60 but among women, the IRR=0.95. Is gender a:
