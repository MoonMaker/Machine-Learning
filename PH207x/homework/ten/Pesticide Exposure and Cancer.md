# Pesticide Exposure and Cancer #
Dr. Patel is interested in examining whether pesticide exposure is associated with a rare form of cancer. Since it is difficult to find enough cases to study, she decides to try and identify all cases in a large region. Since men and people younger than 50 are both more likely to be exposed to pesticides and more likely to develop this form of cancer, she obtains a random sample of people that did not develop the cancer living in the same region, matched to the case within 5 years of age and the same sex.  
  
##### 1. True or False: In this study, the matching eliminates the association between pesticide use and age. #####
* True
* False 

##### 2. First, Dr. Patel conducts an analysis that ignores the matching in the design and finds that the odds of developing cancer is 1.35 times greater among those exposed to the pesticide compared to those who were not exposed. If she then conducted another analysis that takes the matching into account, she would likely find an association of. #####
