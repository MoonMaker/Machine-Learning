#Diabetes Prevalence
Use Stata and the NHLBI data set to report the prevalence of diabetes among only those participants who attended and had non-missing data for diabetes at all three examinations. (Hint: There were 3,206 such participants.)

Simply follow the smoking example in Stata Demo 2.1 Handout (Step 4) to create a new variable for people for whom diabetes status was captured at all three visits (total = 3206 as stated in the question) and then run a multiple one-way table for diabetes* with a restriction of your new variable equaling 1 (Step 4.a.iv).


1. What is the prevalence of diabetes at the first exam (diabetes1=1)? 
gen dianotmiss=diabetes1<. & diabetes2<. & diabetes3<.
tab1 diabetes1 diabetes2 diabetes3 if dianotmiss==1
=0.0181

2. What is the prevalence of diabetes at the second exam (diabetes2=1)? 
=0.0328

3. What is the prevalence of diabetes at the third exam (diabetes3=1)? 
=0.0783
